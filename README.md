It adds a list of utilities like autoclickers and cps counters "into" your roblox via an overlay using window hooks
said utilities are accessed via the roblox icon in the top left corner

If the roblox icon doesnt show up in the top right corner it means you HAVEN'T DOWNLOADED THE REQUIRED DLL's!
make sure to download them and put them in the same folder as the executable
